# ðŸ¦  AI-Based COVID Detection System

This is a multi-component AI project developed during my internship. It integrates *Computer Vision* and *Data Analysis* to assist in early detection and understanding of COVID-19. The entire system runs as a simple and interactive *Streamlit web application*.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Features

### 1. ðŸ–¼ Chest X-ray Classifier
- Upload a chest X-ray image.
- Predicts whether the X-ray shows signs of:
  - *COVID*
  - *Normal*
  - *Viral Pneumonia*
- Powered by a deep learning model (covid_xray_model.keras) built using TensorFlow/Keras.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Test Image

You can test the model using sample chest X-ray images provided in the sample_xrays/ folder.

To test:
1. Go to the *ðŸ©» X-ray Classifier* tab in the app
2. Upload one of the sample images:
   - covid_sample.jpg
   - normal_sample.jpg

### 2. ðŸ“Š WHO COVID-19 Global Data Analysis
- Uses official WHO dataset (WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv)
- Visualizes:
  - Top 10 countries with highest total reported cases
  - Daily new cases
  - Cumulative case trends by country
  - Raw data display for selected country

ðŸ“„ The WHO COVID dataset is large and may not preview in GitHub, but it is included in the repository and used directly by the Streamlit app.
